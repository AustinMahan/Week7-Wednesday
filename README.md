# Modifying an Existing, Complicated Project
- Bootstrap fun!
- Hook up all the parts!

## Set Up Instructions

**In the index.html file:**<br>
1. Insert the link to the application.css file.<br>
2. Insert the script for the jQuery CDN.<br>
3. Insert the script to link the main.js file.<br>

*Hint: take a look back on index.html files from previous weeks to see where/how these steps were done.*

## DO IT!
### First things first:###
*Check out how much prepackaged goodness you get with bootstrap by looking at the super small amount of code in the css file*

1. When hovering over the new message count badge, the background color of the badge should change from dark grey to dark red (#b20000).
2. For better contrast change the background color of every other panel to grey (#cccccc).
3. Create a <span> node with the message "2016 projection" and set it to a variable called message.
4. Place the message in the Success bar in the Reports panel. It should only appear when the user hovers over the Success bar. **You should not alter the html or css for this task.**
5. In the table that contains Visits, ROI, and Source, delete the last two rows that contain no data.
